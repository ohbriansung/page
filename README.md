## Abstraction

Some people prefer to go to GitHub and interact with the source code.
Some people prefer to see the portfolio website and read the documentations.
Therefore, I wanted to provide the access to both sides and I wanted to have a more efficient way to manage the contents.

## Introduction

This website was built with React.js and hosted with GitHub Pages.
The backend of this website is actually GitHub.
The contents on this website are not hard coded in the source code or any file in this repository.
You will be able to understand this part later in this article.
